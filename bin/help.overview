> From the github page:

just is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands.

This readme is also available as a book.

(中文文档在 这里, 快看过来!)

Commands, called recipes, are stored in a file called justfile with syntax inspired by make.

You can then run them with just RECIPE:

$ just test-all
cc *.c -o main
./test --all
Yay, all your tests passed!
